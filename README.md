# Python---HEART-DISEASE-PROJECT

This project aims to classify whether a patient is at risk of a heart attack using various machine learning models.
The dataset used for this project is the UCI Heart Disease Dataset, and the models built include Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, and Random Forest.


Tasks Performed
Data Analysis:
Imported and explored the dataset.

Data Visualization:
Visualized the distribution of heart disease and non-heart disease patients.
Plotted age vs disease status and correlation heatmaps.

Machine Learning Models:
Logistic Regression: Built a logistic regression model, split the data 70:30 for training and testing, and evaluated performance.
Decision Tree: Built a decision tree classifier, evaluated accuracy and confusion matrix
Random Forest: Built a Random Forest model, achieved an accuracy of 82%

Model Evaluation:
Confusion matrices, classification reports, and performance metrics like precision, recall, and F1 score were calculated.
Random Forest was selected as the best model due to its highest accuracy and balanced confusion matrix.

Key Results
Best Model: Random Forest with 82% accuracy.

Technologies Used
Python
Libraries: Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn
